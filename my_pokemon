### Globals

# `rng` is a python Random number generator
# `rng.random()` returns a random float between 0 and 1
# `rng.randint(a, b)` returns a random integer between a and b (inclusive)

# `SELECT setseed(seed);` sets the postgres random seed to `seed`
# `SELECT * FROM Table ORDER BY random() LIMIT 5;` gives 5 random rows from the table `Table`
# `SELECT setseed(seed);` should be used once, before any calls to random(), with the a random number generated by `rng.random()`
